# No More Sleeping Alone
This simple mod checks all your pawns to see if any have the negative **Sleeping Alone** mood, as there is no system in the game to warn you by default.

Sounds like a non-issue until everyone is in a mental break, and that -4 was the straw that broke the camel's back!

# How it works
It scans every pawn in the map every 3600 ticks (approx. 1 IRL minute at 1x speed), checking to see if any have the mood. If so, it adds them to a list and displays it as an alert at the bottom right of your screen.

# Install
Download the ZIP, extract it, and move into the local **Mods** folder in the game installation folder.

It should look like this, for example on steam:
- steamapps/common/Rimworld/Mods/NoMoreSleepingAlone

Other platforms should be similar.

# Compatibility

Supports v1.6 as that's what I play. It probably works in older versions but it's untested. The mod is simple enough you can probably fix it yourself if errors arise.

Should be compatible with any mod. If a mod suppresses the Sleeping Alone mood then it will not flag those pawns.
